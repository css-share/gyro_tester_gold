HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) SPI_D direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy.

Port pin INOUT inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) design_2_i/SPI_D direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (SPI_D_OBUF) connected to this hierarchical pin/port, but both were not found.
