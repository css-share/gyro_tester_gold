INFO: [Project 1-236] Implementation specific constraints were found while reading constraint file [/home/cdickins/reuse/gyro_tester_gold-master/gyro_tester_gold/gyro_tester_gold/gyro_tester_gold.srcs/sources_1/bd/design_2/ip/design_2_processing_system7_0_0/design_2_processing_system7_0_0.xdc]. These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/design_2_processing_system7_0_0_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/design_2_processing_system7_0_0_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.
